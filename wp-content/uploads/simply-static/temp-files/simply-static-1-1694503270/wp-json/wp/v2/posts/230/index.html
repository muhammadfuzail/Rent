Food in the Seychelles is a melting pot of cultural influences that have been blended with the islands\u2019 natural bounty of fruits, spices and ocean-fresh seafood. Here are our top picks of places to experience authentic Creole cuisine:<\/p>\n<p><strong>MARIE-ANTOINETTE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This Seychelles restaurant is housed in a hundred-year-old colonial-style building in the heart of Victoria. As the Seychelles\u2019 oldest restaurant, this establishment serves up delicious food prepared according to traditional Creole recipes. In fact, the menu has not changed much since the restaurant first opened in 1972, and you can still enjoy Creole specialities such as battered parrot fish, octopus curry and Chauve Souris Frugivore (curried fruit bat).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-36100 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1.jpeg 900w, http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/projects\/scorpbitprojects\/Github\/Rent\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/food3-1-240x160.jpeg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Opening hours:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Monday to Saturday: 12:00-14:30 (Lunch) | 18:30-21:00 (Dinner)<\/p>\n<p><strong>BAZAR LABRIN<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every Wednesday night, the Seychelles\u2019 most popular beach,\u00a0Beau Vallon, is transformed into a vibrant market with colourful stalls appearing at the side of the road, selling popular Seychelles street food at traditional prices. Fresh fruit juices, handmade souvenirs and local artwork are also on sale, lending a kaleidoscopic ambience to the evening. As the sun sinks below the horizon, twinkling bonfires light up on the beach for the Seychelles\u2019 traditional moutay dance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opening hours:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wednesdays: 16:30-21:00<\/p>\n<p><strong>STREET FOOD IN VICTORIA<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The narrow streets of Victoria are lined with tiny shops and food stalls, each offering a unique insight into the culinary culture of the Seychelles. Take a stroll through the bustling\u00a0capital\u00a0and make sure to sample local Creole cuisine while searching for souvenirs and admiring the local architecture.
